# pgManage - A fast PostgreSQL admin tool
 
A fast replacement for PGAdmin!

Free for personal or commercial use. Postage was created to show off Envelope, our web application platform that makes building desktop-quality database applications on top of PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server a breeze.

Postage was the first free, open source application to use a modern architecture for managing a PostgreSQL database. Due to the efforts of the Workflow Products team and the Envelope codebase, Postage was benchmarked to be the fastest PostgreSQL Administration application for it's entire first year. During that time it acquired thousands of users from dozens of countries all across the world.

Postage has set the baseline of PostgreSQL Admin app speed and feature set and we are excited to witness the resulting growth and competition in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.
