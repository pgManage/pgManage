# Postage - A fast PostgreSQL admin tool 

A fast replacement for PGAdmin!

# If this is your first time trying Postage:
# Do not use 'GIT CLONE' to get Postage!

If you'd like to try Postage please go to ["Releases"](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/releases) and download the appropriate package for your OS. The names of these packages start with "Postage", not "Source Code". The team has spent a ridiculous amount of time ensuring you have an easy, convenient installer for your OS. Please use it. Compiling Postage from source will only give you the server version and all first time users should try the desktop version first. 

Postage can be run in two modes:

### Application mode
Releases marked "3.x.x" are Application mode packages. They run in a desktop window and can connect to Postgres locally or remotely. Please go to ["Releases"](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/releases) and download the appropriate package for your OS. The names of these packages start with "Postage". Do NOT download the versions marked "Source Code". These packages are self contained and very easy to install and remove. Note that all the thanks for our wonderful installation process goes to Github and the Electron team. If you are inexperienced in compiling software you want this mode.

**NOTE:** We do not sign the Windows releases, but we do sign the macOS releases.

### Web Server mode
Releases marked "Source code" run like a web server. This enables you to connect to Postage from any browser, even on a phone. Remember to set your firewall appropriately, or even better, use a VPN. This mode is the only mode available for phone/tablet access. This mode makes it easy to install Postage on one box, then have multiple developers log in and work. We also find it convenient when we're at a client site and need to work from whatever workstation we're in front of at that moment. The names of these packages start with "Source Code". If you have trouble please file an issue (even if you know how to get around it) and we'll get right on it. 

## Release Schedule

Currently we release twice a month. 

## FEEDBACK AND BUG REPORTS

Please contact us with your feedback! Github issues and pull requests are welcome. Please report any issues you have for [FREE support](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues). We can also be reached by phone. Current contact info is available at [WorkflowProducts.com](http://www.workflowproducts.com/about.html). We welcome phone calls during normal daytime hours Central Standard Time.

## Licensing

Postage is built on Envelope technology. Postage and Envelope are products of Workflow Products, LLC. However, we would very much like Postage to be a community project. Anyone presenting a quality patch that asks for commit privileges will likely receive them! 

Postage is free for personal and commercial use. Our understanding of the Apache license is that you may use our code for any purpose as long as you mark our code with our copywrite and a reference to the license. This way we get credit for our work and you can incorporate it into any project or product. 

If you like some or all of Postage's functionality and the current license won't suit your needs, you may request a different license. However, if you require us to sign something we will charge you $99. Please contact Justin at Workflow Products if you have questions. 

## Why?

There are official graphical clients but they are slow. We wanted something fast and were in the position to write it for ourselves.

Then we decided to open source it. Looking back, I'm pretty sure the logic was: step one, write Postage; step two, ???; step three, profit! We're still trying to figure out step two. 

For now, we are grateful for the PostgreSQL project and all of the contributers to the project, so we're glad to give something back. 

## NEW PROJECTS

Postage is rapidly reaching a maintenance state. We have a list of applications that we feel would benefit the PostgreSQL ecosystem and if our resources permit, we'll be writing those apps too. 

If you represent a company that is looking to make a difference in the PostgreSQL ecosystem please contact us. We have a list of applications that we feel would benefit the PostgreSQL ecosystem. If you want to make waves in the PostgreSQL community, please give us a call. It's never been faster, cheaper or easier to produce useful PostgreSQL-based applications and we expect the gaping holes in the PostgreSQL ecosystem to close quickly now. 

## Envelope 

Postage is pretty awesome. It's also a demonstration of [Envelope](https://github.com/workflowproducts/envelope), our application platform that makes building desktop-quality database applications on top of PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server a breeze.

Once you try Postage we hope it inspires you to have a look at Envelope. Envelope can help you leverage your SQL skills to build rich web and desktop database applications in less time than you ever thought possible. 

If you do give Postage a try then you have our gratitude. Let us know what you think and we'll make it better!

## Roadmap

Postage is rapidly reaching a maintenance state. There is only one large feature we're working on.

Workflow Products has committed an embarrassing amount of resources to Postage over the years. The current average for 2017 is over one full time person and holding.  Do you know of a feature that would make Postage better? Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues).

Workflow Products itself is healthier than it's ever been. We celebrated our tenth year in November 2016. We're now at five full time employees. If you have any further questions please contact us directly. We'd love to hear from you.

## Internationalization

Anyone wishing to contribute to a translation, please post to [issue #59](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues/59).

Since Postage runs in a browser we don't really know what will happen if you use Postage with a non-UTF8 PostgreSQL database. If you experience a problem then please post an issue to [Github Issues](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues). 

## Contributing

The best way to contribute to Postage is to start by posting an issue. Please read the [README_DEV](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/blob/master/README_DEV.md) file for full details.

If you'd like to support Postage and you're in a position to get us paid work then that helps a lot. We mostly do fussy custom ERP solutions for the Aerospace and Medical industries. Any kind of accounting or inventory application is right up our alley, especially the complex stuff. Our specialty is implementing new systems without disrupting operations (training-free implementations).
